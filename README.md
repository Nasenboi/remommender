The Remommender is an application for recommending music based on emotion observed in real-time speech. When you start
talking, the web app will automatically select music based on the emotion it detects in your speech. The app was 
developed as part of the _Music informatics_ course at the 
[University of Applied Sciences DÃ¼sseldorf](https://www.hs-duesseldorf.de/).

This repository contains the source code for the entire application (backend and frontend). The documentation can be 
found in the [project wiki](https://github.com/Nasenboi/remommender/wiki).
